# summation


A lightweight Go utility that calculates the arithmetic series (the sum of all integers) from zero up to a user-defined limit.
🚀 How it Works

The program prompts the user for a "favorite number" via the terminal. It then iterates through every integer from 0 up to (but not including) that number, accumulating the total.

Mathematically, this represents the summation:

j=0∑n−1​j

🛠 Features

    Interactive Input: Uses fmt.Scan to capture user data at runtime.

    Input Validation: Basic error handling to ensure only integers are processed.

    Clean Scope: Demonstrates the use of local variables and function return values to avoid "side effects."
